To install:
1. Download the disk image
2. Mount it and drag the app into the alias of the Applications folder in the disk image. Your Mac may ask for your administrator password, enter it if prompted. The app will now be in the main Applications folder.

To use:
1. Make sure that your iPod's main volume (formatted to MacOS Extended) is called iPod HD.
2. Connect the iPod to your Mac. Note: You can only sync one iPod at one time.
3. Launch the app. If it asks you permission to access files, Contacts, and a removable disk, allow it. By the way, the "removable disk" is just your iPod's disk.
4. Your Contacts have now been synced. Note: You will have to launch the app again if you update your Contacts.
5. Empty the trash. (The folder that you want to delete is already in the trash. It is called "contacts to sync". The app created some temporary files in this folder and then moved the folder to the trash.)

To update:
1. Follow the installation steps above.
2. When it asks whether to replace the older item in your Applications folder with a new one (or something like that), tap "replace".
